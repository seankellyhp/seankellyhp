Hi, I'm Sean. I enjoyed long walks on the beach, but then I moved to Munich, Germany. Now, you'll mostly find me applying big data and data science to problems in communication and media studies research. In this profile you will find a mix of projects from my academic research, in addition to a fair amount of personal musings.
