  Hi, I'm Sean. I enjoyed long walks on the beach, but then I moved to Munich, Germany. Now, you'll mostly find me applying big data and data science to socially relevant issues in communication and media studies research. In this profile you will find a mix of projects from my academic research, in addition to a fair amount of personal musings.
